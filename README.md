## Specifications
1] When you click on the input field, a list of items will appear.

2] As you type, the list should show only items that match what you're typing.

3] Clicking on an item should turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field should adjust automatically.

4] Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.

5] Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.


## Bonus Task
1] Clean code.

2] TypeScript

3] When the input is blank and the user presses backspace, the last chip (for example, Nick Giannopoulos) should get highlighted and on again pressing backspace it should get deleted


## Notes
1] Make sure you code your solution in React (CRA/NextJS).

2] Make sure you build the component from scratch and do not use any component-based library like MUI, Chakra UI etc.

3] You are free to use CSS solutions like TailwindCss/SCSS.
